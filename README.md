### Description
This was a Friday project for  Epicodus it has the following functionality:

There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.

When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

The application will return the total cost of the order.

Pierre offers the following deals:

Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free. A single loaf costs $5.
Pastry: Buy 1 for \$2 or 3 for $5.

All functionality for the models should be tested.
